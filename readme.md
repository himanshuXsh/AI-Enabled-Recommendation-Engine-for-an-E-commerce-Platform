## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/himanshuXsh/AI-Enabled-Recommendation-Engine-for-an-E-commerce-Platform.git
cd AI-Enabled-Recommendation-Engine-for-an-E-commerce-Platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Dataset
Download the RetailRocket dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset):
- `events.csv`
- `item_properties_part1.csv`
- `item_properties_part2.csv`

Place these files in the `data/` folder.

### 4. Prepare Data
```bash
python setup_data.py
```

This will create:
- `data/user_item_matrix.csv`
- `data/clean_interactions.csv`
- `data/clean_items.csv`

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loads 2.7M user interactions (view, addtocart, transaction)
- Cleans data: handles missing values, removes duplicates
- Creates User-Item Interaction Matrix (4,517 × 3,000)

### 2. Collaborative Filtering

**User-Based:**
```python
1. Find users similar to target user (cosine similarity)
2. Get items those similar users liked
3. Rank by weighted scores
4. Return top-N recommendations
```

**Item-Based:**
```python
1. Find items similar to target item (cosine similarity)
2. Rank by similarity scores
3. Return top-N similar items
```

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Split data into train/test sets
- Calculate Precision, Recall, F1-Score @ k={5, 10, 15}
- Optimize for best k value (k=10 performed best)

### 4. Deployment
- Built interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Implemented caching for fast recommendations
- Added AI chatbot for natural language queries
